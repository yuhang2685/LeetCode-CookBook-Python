# LeetCode-CookBook-Python

## Goal
More than a bunch of problem solutions,
the cookbook aims at helping you become an expert at Data structures and Algorithms.
At the end,
you not only have solved a lot of problems,
but also have a crystal understanding of them.
That is, solving a problem is just a daily action of you.

Therefore,
LeetCode problems are no more individual problems,
but a repository of problems with connections of similarity and variance.
Furthermore,
you should not solve the problem one by one staring from problem #1.
You have to spend extra time for making connections between the problems,
categorizing problems into different groups,
and design a common working strategy for each group.

Although it will be slower at the beginning,
but it will be much faster at the end with gaining you additional higher level abilities.
There will be strategies and tips for managing your time wisely through the journey.

## Map
Sub-folders in groups "Analysis-Solutions", "Algorithms" and "Data-structures" are "nodes".
It helps you to organize your knowledge.
With time passing, you should have a virtual map for those nodes and connections in your brain.
That is, 
LeetCode problems are no more a linearly ordered sequence,
but a graph.

## Schedule 
One month on "Easy-Medium" questions:
They are the start point of the journey for expanding your power.
They are the individual building blocks for future.
You do not have to go through all of them, 
because many of them are not worth spending the same amount of efforts (See [Tips](#tips)).
They provide you the chance for understanding and getting familiar with concepts and properties,
as well as designing and practising your strategy.

Then one "Medium-Hard" problem per day:
They are essential parts of LeetCode and Tech interviews.
They are your ultimal targets, which are real interview questions.
They are more complexed problems which require you to use your building blocks flexibly.
They are problems composed of lower level problems and with new restrictions.

## Time Management
Only spend less than 20-30 minutes for generating a solution without implementation.
See "How to come up with own solutions".

On one hand, 
it trains you to get used to the real interview scene.

On the other hand, 
remember your goal is to get the problem-solving ability throught the training.
Your time is valuable, you have to spend your time wisely.
You do not have to beat every question during the training. 
The failure guides you by showing what knowledge do you need to make up, 
and what skills do you need to spend your time for.
See "How to check with other solutions".


## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find and write down input-output-functionality.
* Find and write down restrictions.
* Connect to tricks commonly used for this topic and write down.
* Sketch conceptuality of the problem using above steps and run it.
* Decompose using modulization.
* Pseudocode.


## How to implement your own solutions
- #### Open a notebook to write it down. 
- #### Review with considering the margin cases.
- #### Copy it to LeetCode and submit.
- #### Record bugs and do analysis.
- #### Check other solutions for improvements.


## How to check with other solutions
- #### Use "Debugger" to understand the solution step by step
- #### Find topic connections from it
- #### Mark the problem number down and do it with "How to come up with own solutions" in the near future


## Tips
- #### Use filters. E.g., pick "Top 100 Liked Questions".
- #### Do not work on the problems with :-1: >> :+1:. 
- #### Only view discussion with :+1: >> :-1:.
- #### Finish the problem by checking solutions for any improvements.
- #### Do not chase shorter codes, they might not reduce time complexity (estimate and mind-compile), but reduce the readability.
- #### You will be skilled at coding finally, but focus on solving with correctness and time-space complexity at the beginning.
- #### Do not RUSH! The faster is the slower; The slower is the faster.
