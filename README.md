# LeetCode-CookBook-Python

## Purpose
More than a bunch of problem solutions,
the cookbook focus on the strategies for spending your time wisely to improve your ability.

## Map
Analysis-Solutions, Algorithms and Data-structures are "nodes".
We find connections between them which improve your ability dramatically.
With time passing, you should have a virtual map for the book contents in your brain.

## Schedule 
One month on "Easy-Medium" questions. 
You do not have to go through all of them one by one, 
because many of them are similar. (see what questins to work with)
They provide you the chance for understanding concepts, properties and skills as your building blocks,
and the chance for practice with them.

Then one "Medium-Hard" problem per day. 
They are essential parts of LeetCode and Tech interviews.
They are your ultimal targets, which are real interview questions.
They are more complexed questions which require you use your building blocks flexibly.

## Time Management
Only spend less than 20-30 minutes for generating a solution without implementation.
See "" for how to generate a solution.

On one hand, 
it trains you to get used to the real interview scene.

On the other hand, 
remember your goal is to get the problem-solving ability throught the training.
Your time is valuable, you have to spend your time wisely.
You do not have to beat every question during the training. 
The failure guides you by showing what knowledge do you need to make up, 
and what skills do you need to spend your time for.

## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege.
* Understand the question.
* Abstract the information.
* Conception to replace the text description.
* Identify the pattern.
* Connect to topics in your knowledge base.
* Decompose modulization with input-output-functionality.
* Pseudocode.

## How to implement your own solutions
* Open a notebook to write it down. 
* Review before copy to LeetCode and submit.
* Recode bugs and do analysis.

## How to check solutions
Find connections. Use "Debugger" to understand the solution.

## Tips (Be Picky)
- #### Use filters. For example, pick "Top 100 Liked Questions" etc..
- #### Do not work on the problems with "Unlike" greater than "like".
- #### Only view discuss with "uphands" greater than "downhands".
