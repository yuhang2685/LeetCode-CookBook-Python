# LeetCode-CookBook-Python

## Purpose
More than a bunch of problem solutions,
the cookbook focus on the strategies for spending your time wisely to improve your ability.

## Map
Topics "Analysis-Solutions", "Algorithms" and "Data-structures" are "nodes".
We will find their connections which will improve your ability dramatically.
With time passing, you should have a virtual map for those contents in your brain.

## Schedule 
One month on "Easy-Medium" questions. 
You do not have to go through all of them one by one, 
because many of them are not worth spending the same amount of efforts. (See [Tips](#tips))
They provide you the chance for understanding concepts, properties and skills as your building blocks,
and also the chance for practice with them.

Then one "Medium-Hard" problem per day. 
They are essential parts of LeetCode and Tech interviews.
They are your ultimal targets, which are real interview questions.
They are more complexed questions which require you use your building blocks flexibly.

## Time Management
Only spend less than 20-30 minutes for generating a solution without implementation.
See "How to come up with own solutions".

On one hand, 
it trains you to get used to the real interview scene.

On the other hand, 
remember your goal is to get the problem-solving ability throught the training.
Your time is valuable, you have to spend your time wisely.
You do not have to beat every question during the training. 
The failure guides you by showing what knowledge do you need to make up, 
and what skills do you need to spend your time for.
See "How to check solutions".

## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find input-output-functionality.
* Find restrictions.
* Abstract the description with above steps.
* Build a conception of the problem using above steps.
* Connect to topics using the abstraction.
* Decompose using modulization.
* Pseudocode.


## How to implement your own solutions
* Open a notebook to write it down. 
* Review before copy it to LeetCode and submit.
* Record bugs and do analysis.

## How to check solutions
* Use "Debugger" to understand the solution step by step
* Find topic connections from it
* Mark the problem number down and do it with "How to come up with own solutions" in the near future

## Tips
- #### Use filters. E.g., pick "Top 100 Liked Questions".
- #### Do not work on the problems with "unlike" >> "like".
- #### Only view discussion with "uphands" >> "downhands".
