# LeetCode-CookBook-Python


## Goal

Although the book will contain a bunch of problem solutions, we demand more. 
The cookbook aims at helping us become a real expert at Data structures and Algorithms.
At the end, we will be skilled at solving problems.
Instead of through hard working on problems again and again,
our motivation is 
to develop problem-solving skills wisely 
by applying and deveoping meta-skills such as abstracting, finding properties, connecting, comparing, evaluating, etc..
(A cool tool is Category Theory, isn't it?)
Moreover, there will be a collection of common procedures and steps, guidelines and tips available.

Therefore, through this project, 
we hope to gain the ability to 
collect and develop (by abstracting) strategy 
for developing meta-skills 
for developing problem-solving skills.
They can be viewed by layers.
Also, we develop the abilities of supplying common procedures and steps, guidelines and tips.
The abilities and strategy are applicable to any domains of materials.


# How to use LeetCode
Therefore,
LeetCode problems are no more isolated individual problems,
but a repository of problems with hidden connections of similarity and variance.
We need to manage time wisely instead of work on everyone starting from problem #1 which is frustrating.
The repository are trainings for developing individual skills
and applying them flexibly and logically.
Moreover, it is used for abstracting the common procedures and steps for solving a problem.

Although it will be slower at the beginning,
but it will become much faster at the end with additional gain of higher level abilities.


## Map
The knowledges are organized in groups "Analysis-Solutions", "Algorithms" and "Data-structures".
More than a structure, 
with time passing, we should have a virtual map in our brain for contents as nodes and connections as pathes.
That is, LeetCode problems are no more in a linearly ordered sequence,
but a graph of nodes and connections.


## Schedule 
One month on "Easy-Medium" questions:
They are the start point of the journey for expanding our power.
They are the individual building blocks for future.
We do not have to go through all of them, 
because many of them are not worth spending the same amount of efforts (See [Tips](#tips)).
They provide us the chance for understanding and getting familiar with concepts and properties, see 0026 for example. 

Then one "Medium-Hard" problem per day:
They are essential parts of LeetCode, 
because they are closer to real daily problems to solve.
They are more complexed problems composed of lower level problems with new restrictions,
which require us to play with building blocks flexibly and logically.


## Time Management
Only spend less than 20-30 minutes for generating a solution without implementation.
See "How to come up with own solutions".

On one hand, 
it trains us to get used to the real interview scene.

On the other hand, 
remember our goal is to get the problem-solving ability throught the training.
Our time is valuable, we have to spend our time wisely.
We do not have to beat every question during the training. 
The failure guides us to next success by showing what knowledge do we need to make up, 
and what skills do we need to spend your time for.
See "How to check with other solutions".


## How to come up with own solutions
(See 0026 for example)
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find and write down input-output-functionality.
* Find and write down restrictions.
* Abstract tasks and information to higher level.
* Determine what groups it belongs to.
* Connect to tricks commonly used for these groups and estimate if they help to make the tasks easier.
* Decompose the tasks into sub-tasks according to tricks and mark them down.
* Manipulate this optional solution with an example.
* Find other solutions and repeat above steps, and then estimate time-space complexity.
* Pick one solution and write Pseudocode.


## How to implement your own solutions
* Never start before coming up with own solutions.
* It is where we make our hands dirty.
* Open a notebook to write it down. 
* Starting with structures and comment briefly for each part.
* Top-down refining with an example.
* Double check with the margin cases.
* Draw test cases and manipulate them with our code.
* Use compiler knowledge on codes for possible optimization. 
* Optimize our codes by combining redundant, but sometimes it reduces readibility.


## After implementation
- #### Copy it to LeetCode and submit.
- #### Record bugs and do analysis (See 0026 for example).
- #### Check with other solutions for improvements.


## How to check with other solutions
- #### Benefit to check with standard solutions and those in "Discuss".
- #### Abstract the tricks to extend our tricks set for this topic.
- #### Evaluate and compare all solutions.
- #### Use "Debugger" to understand the solution step by step.
- #### Mark the problem number down and review it in the near future.


## Tips
* Use filters. E.g., pick "Top 100 Liked Questions".
* Do not work on the problems with :-1: >> :+1:. 
* Only view discussion with :+1: >> :-1:.
* Do not chase conciseness intensively, they might not improve time complexity (estimate and mind-compile), but sacrifices the readability.
* We will be skilled at concise coding finally, but focus on solving with correctness and time-space complexity at the beginning.
* Do not RUSH! The faster is the slower; The slower is the faster.
* Optimization and conciseness are different.
* Keep in mind the operations can be arranged in different structures, by trade off between readibility and conciseness.
* Instead of hacking on solving problems, it benefits by reviewing sloved problems as well as different solutions and evaluating them. 
* Easy problems for developing individual basic skills and tricks.
* Hard problems for logically applying a bunch of basic skills and tricks.
