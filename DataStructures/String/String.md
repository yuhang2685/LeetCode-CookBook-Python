## General ideas

In Python3, **String** is a kind of **Array** where the elements are ASCII characters, but it is **_immutable_**.
Therefore the algorithms and tricks for **Array** are inherited for **String**.

Useful Data Structures are 
- Hash Table
- Set

Useful Algorithms are 
- Two Pointers

Useful Tricks are 
- ~~Sorting~~
- Loop through
