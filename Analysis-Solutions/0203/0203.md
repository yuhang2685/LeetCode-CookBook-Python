# 0203. Remove Linked List Elements

## General ideas
A straight forward solution is to travel along the LinkedList with a pointer node "curr", 
and also a pointer node "prev" which keeps track of the previous node of "curr". 
Once the content of "curr" is "val", then "prev" connects to the next node of "curr".

Be aware of the case that the content of given "head" is "val".  

Another solution is "Recursion" which will be made up after working with it.


## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find and write down input-output-functionality.
  - input: a LinkedList and a 'val'
  - output: a LinkedList
  - functionality: supply a LinkedList similar to the given one but without 'val'
* Find and write down restrictions.
* Abstract tasks and information to higher level conceptuality.
* Determine what groups it belongs to.
  - LinkedList
* Connect to tricks commonly used for these groups and estimate if they help to make the tasks easier.
  - Two Pointers
  - Recursion
  - Hash Table
  - List
  - Set
* Decompose the tasks into sub-tasks according to tricks and mark them down.
* Manipulate this optional solution with an example to make sure it works.
* Find other solutions and repeat above steps, and then estimate their time-space complexity.
* Pick one solution and switch to implement.
