Note :-1: >> :+1: suggests "Analysis" and sketch are enough rather than a full correct implementation.

## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find input-output-functionality.
  - input: A sorted array of numbers
  - output: Length
  - functionality: Modify the array to have no duplications within the returned length
* Find restrictions.
  - Sorted
  - In-place
* Abstract the description with above steps.
  - Sorted
  - Array
  - Remove duplication
  - In-place
* Connect to topics using the abstraction.
  - Sorted => next element is either equal or greater
  - Array => random access, margin
  - Duplication => same, comparison
  - In-place => swap
* Imagine a conception of the problem using above steps and run it.
* Decompose using modulization.
* Pseudocode.
