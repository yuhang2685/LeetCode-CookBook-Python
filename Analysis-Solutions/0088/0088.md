# 88. Merge Sorted Array

## General ideas

The question asks to merge array2 into array1, we had better use backward pointers.

If the question asks to merge array1 and array2 to a new array, then you can also use forward pointers.

Recursion is not suit for this question. 
I guess because it restricts to merge array2 into array1, which is hard to manipulate, i.e., inserting element ahead and shifiting rest elements.
