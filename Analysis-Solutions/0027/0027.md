Note :-1: >> :+1: suggests "Analysis" and sketch are enough rather than a full correct implementation.

It is similar to 0026 and 0283. 

The difference is restriction "Order does not matter", which connects to a possible backward 2nd-pointer and contents swapping.

Another note is swapping is not mandatory, since one side is always "val".
