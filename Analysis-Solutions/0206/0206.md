# 0206. Reverse Linked List

## General idea
Reverse the given LinkedList means changing the node links, without changing the node contents.

1. A straight forward solution is travelling through the LinkedList and change the link of a node after visiting it.

2. Another solution is to do it recrusively.

3. A possible solution is to store the nodes in order in an extra Data Structure, and then change the node links one by one. But it is inefficient.


## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find and write down input-output-functionality.
  - input: a LinkedList
  - output: a LinkedList
  - functionality: reversed the given LinkedList
* Find and write down restrictions.
  - iteratively
  - recursively
* Abstract tasks and information to higher level as a conceptuality.
* Determine what groups it belongs to.
  - LinkedList
* Connect to tricks commonly used for these groups and estimate if they help to make the tasks easier.
  - Hash Table
  - List
  - Set
  - Two Pointers: Prev-Curr, Slow-Fast
  - Recursion
  - Dummy Node
  - Loop through
* Decompose the tasks into sub-tasks according to tricks and mark them down.
* Manipulate this optional solution with a general example to make sure it works.
* Find other solutions and repeat above steps, and then estimate their time-space complexity.
* Pick one solution and move on to implement.
