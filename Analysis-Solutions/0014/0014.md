# 14. Longest Common Prefix

## General ideas
The straight foward solution is from the definition, which is called **Vertical scanning** in the stardard solutions.

A similar straight forward solution is called **Horizontal scanning**, 
which uses *isSubstring()* for the prefix (initialized to the first string) and the second string, 
keep shrinking prefix until find one.
Continue to use the obtained prefix for the third string and so on.

Other solutions are **Divide and Conquer**, **Binary Search**, and **Trie**. We will come back for the solutions.
