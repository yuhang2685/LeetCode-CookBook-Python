# 242. Valid Anagram

## General ideas
The problem is to decide if two strings have same chars with same appearences.
We have to compare the chars and also their appearences.

A straight forward solution is to sort both to become easier to compare individual chars and their appearences.

Another straight forward solution is without sorting, but store individual chars and appearences in a data structure like "key-value" pairs,
which could be a Hash Table, or in the string case could be a size-26 array.

Note in Python3, we can compare if two Hash Tables are identical by "==", as well as two arrays.
I guess because Python3 "==" for contents.
