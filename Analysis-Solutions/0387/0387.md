# 0387. First Unique Character in a String

## General ideas
The straight forward solution is to loop through every chars in order and loop through the rest chars to compare with.
The time complexity will be O(n^2).

Another stright forward solution is to count for how many times each char appears in the string, can use **Array** or **Hash Table** for storing the counters.
Then with another loop through the string to find the first char which has the counter for 1.

More advanced solution is "one-pass" with a set for all showup chars, 
and with a Hash Table storing the position. 
For the first time we see the char, store the position in the Hash Table, and also store the char in the set. 
When it is the second time see the char (decided by seeing the char in the set), delete its entry in the Hash Table.
Therefore finally only 1-showup chars remain.
Then we can use iterator the Hash Table once to get the first stored key (whatever before it has been deleted if they showup more than once).

An improvement for above solution is to use just Hash Table,
where when the first time see the char, it create key-value like above,
but when the second time see the char by checking the key in the Hash Table,
it will change its value to -1.
Finally, for checking the minimum position, it has to do comparasions for the values instead of output the first key-value pair.
