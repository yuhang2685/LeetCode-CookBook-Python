# 136. Single Number

## Analysis and ideas
The question requires to find out the only char which appears just once, where the others all appears 2 times.

- A straight forward solution is to use a data structures to store individual char and delete it when the second showup, say Set, 
because each number showup either once or twice.
However it violates the "Follow up" in using extra memory.

- Another straight forward solution is to use sorting and then check.
Sorting can be done in time complexity "O(nlogn)" or "O(n*n)" which are both linear, 
and in-place in the array (strictly O(1) - the variable for swap) such as "bubble sort" or "insertion sort".

- "Two Points" DOES NOT work because how about p1 points to the second appearence of a char?

- The standard solution3 using "Math" is just one line: "return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)" but it violates the "Follow up" in using extra memory.

- The standard solution4 using "Bit Manipulation" XOR which is tricky.
The idea is bellow: say 5^5=0; 0^5=5; 3^5=whatever; ((3^4)^5)=(3^(4^5))=(3^5)^4;
Therefore for example [2,1,4,5,2,4,1], it is (1^1)^(2^2)^(4^4)^5=5
