# 0328. Odd Even Linked List

## Analysis and Solution
The problem will be simple if we use extra data structures for storing the node values in order.

With the restriction **_O(1) space_** and **_O(n) time_**,
we noticed we are allowed to use some variables.
Instead of recording the value, we record the positions.
So we come up with the idea of using **_Two Pointers_** which is a common trick used for **LinkedList**.
By playing with an example, we believe it can be solved,
because nodes are still those nodes, only their "pointed to" has been changed. 
If we change "node next" and pointers carefully and in good sequence, the implementation won't be hard (see standard solution).
