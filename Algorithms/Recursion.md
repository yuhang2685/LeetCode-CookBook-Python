## General ideas

Recursion goes hand in hand with *loops*.
Sometimes we first figure out a solution using loops, and then convert the solution into Recursion by cases.

Recursion can be implemented starting with the **_base cases_**, followed by the **_inductive_** case. 

**_base cases_** are where the function finishs.

Each case will do some work, and then returns according to the type of the funciton.
