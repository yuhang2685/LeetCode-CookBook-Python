# Binary Search

## General ideas
**Binary Search** is often used for quick searching instead of iteratical searching.

Binary Search often works well with a number where the order of all numbers less than it is kind of "sorted".
It also works well with arrays which allow "random access" and where the elements in arrays are "sorted".

Binary Search can also be implemented in "Recursion".
